        <h2>My Resume</h2>
        <p>Here's my pitch. (Vibrates mediums better than activating retina.)</p>
        <p>My name is Zach Long.  I am currently studying computer science at 
            Virginia Tech.  I taught myself Python in my freshman year of
            high school with the intent to make video games.  Since then I
            have made quite a few games in Python as well as games in Unity
            using C#.  I am currently teaching myself Google's Machine Learning
            API, Tensorflow, HTML/CSS, and Java.  I currently take computer science
            courses like Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.
        </p>
        <p>Since I taught myself to program, I have become highly self-motivated.
            I always have a new project in mind and love to learn new languages
            or API.
